# Purpose

So basically I've been messing around the gnu precompiled headers, and I'm trying to figure out how/when they're worth it. I'm working on integrating support for gnu pch into [Gazebo](http://gazebosim.org) right now, and this is helping me with that effort. Basically just enter any directory and run ./test.sh. The output should be pretty self explanitory.
